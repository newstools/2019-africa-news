                            Economic recovery in Sub-Saharan Africa weakened in 2018, according to the latest edition of Africa’s Pulse, the World Bank’s bi-annual analysis of the state of African economies. Despite a slower-than-expected overall recovery, several economies saw growth pick up in the final quarter of 2018. This edition of Africa’s Pulse also takes a closer look at how fragility is holding countries back, and the role of digital transformation in eradicating poverty.
