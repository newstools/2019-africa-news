Zimbabwe head coach Farai ‘Bob’ Mahari lamented his team’s costly errors.

“A slow start in the first half affected us and we will have to review what went wrong

We made mistakes and they punished us for it and at this level decent teams will punish you. So yes it was mistakes mistakes mistakes.

You can never fault the energy of the boys, they wanted to play but they were probably not doing the right things in the right places,” said Mahari.
