                            The U.S. Embassy in Cairo marked Earth Day 2019 on April 22 by highlighting the need to “Protect Our Species” with friends of Egypt’s environment at the Maadi Public Library. The program raised awareness of the dangers faced by all species through presentations on Egypt’s biodiversity, the Migratory Soaring Birds Project, power lines and other threats to bird migration, and a virtual reality display of the Wadi Degla Museum. Participants also discussed the efforts necessary to mitigate the negative effects of population growth and development on species preservation.

At the event, Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Lisa Vickers highlighted the efforts of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency and other Egyptian partners to address habitat loss, as well as the illegal and unsustainable exploitation of wildlife, habitat, fish and other marine species. According to Vickers, “Today’s event is a call to action to raise awareness to preserve the world’s species that are vulnerable to extinction, and a notice that species preservation starts with each one of us.”



The United States shares the global concern regarding species conservation and the growing challenge to protect species from extinction. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo commends the Egyptian public and private sectors as well as civil society for their efforts to “Protect Our Species.”
