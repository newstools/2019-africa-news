Clashes continued in conflict-affected neighborhoods Khalla al Furjan, Qasr Ben Gashir, Ain Zara, Wadi Rabea and Swani, reportedly with increased use of airstrikes. Prolonged outages of electricity, telecommunications and water networks, as well as reported closure of many markets in conflict-areas further add to the hardship of local populations.

Most displaced households are currently staying with family and in private accommodation in different neighborhoods and suburbs of Tripoli, as well as along the coastal line in Western Libya and the Nafusa mountains; please refer to the second page of this report for more details. Over 1,500 internally displaced persons have been accommodated in collective shelters set up by local authorities.

Currently, around 3,600 migrants remain in detention centers in Tripoli and are among the most vulnerable populations at risk, especially the 890 migrants in Qasr Ben Gashir Detention Centerin direct vicinity of armed conflict.
