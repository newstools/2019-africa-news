                            By President of European Parliament



"I am very concerned by developments in Libya. I appeal to all parties to stop and avoid violence.
                                What is happening in Tripoli cannot have repercussions on the stability and security of the entire southern Mediterranean and Sahel area
                            

“Military action is not the solution to the Libyan crisis. A new conflict would only cause further loss of life and enormous damage to the country and its people. We would also risk generating a new migratory crisis, with increased flows heading mainly towards Italy and other Mediterranean countries.

“Faced with this escalation, the European Union must intervene immediately and speak with a single and authoritative voice, contributing to a peaceful and democratic solution, within the framework of the United Nations, as requested on several occasions by the European Parliament.

“Advances by Haftar’s militias towards Tripoli and possible clashes in the capital would lead the country to a chaotic civil war, breaking the fragile balance established within the framework of the UN-led peace process. There is also a risk that the path towards free and democratic elections, which must be the foundations on which to rebuild a Libyan state based on participation and reconciliation, would be definitively interrupted.

“Only rule of law, with elected institutions, can really guarantee the security of the citizens and relaunch the economy, giving solid prospects to the country.

“Libya is a strategic partner of the European Union and plays a key role in the management of migration flows. What is happening in Tripoli cannot have repercussions on the stability and security of the entire southern Mediterranean and Sahel area.”
