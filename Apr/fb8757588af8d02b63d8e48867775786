LONDON, United Kingdom, April 5, 2019/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            As Mozambican journalist and Prisoner of Conscience, Amade Abubacar, marks 90-days in pretrial detention, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for Southern Africa, Deprose Muchena said:




                                The continued detention of Amade - whose wife and children have not been able to visit him – is against the principle of being innocent until proven guilty
                            

“Mozambican authorities are treating Amade Abubacar like a convicted criminal by prolonging his pretrial detention without bringing any legitimate charges against him in violation of national and international law.



“The continued detention of Amade - whose wife and children have not been able to visit him – is against the principle of being innocent until proven guilty. 



“Amade must either be charged with a recognizable criminal offence or released immediately and allowed to do his job without fear of reprisals. Mozambican authorities must support media freedom, instead of criminalizing journalists.”
