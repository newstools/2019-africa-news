                            Rugby Africa President, Khaled Babbou has notified Unions on the decision of Rugby Africa EXCO to cancel this year’s Silver Cup due to hold at the Lagos Polo Club, Ikoyi in Lagos Nigeria.



The Silver Cup Pool A was scheduled to be played between Nigeria, Ghana, Madagascar and Botswana whilst Pool B was to be played between Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal, Mauritius and Rwanda.

The cancellation became imminent following Kwese Sports premature termination of sponsorship contract leaving Rugby Africa without adequate funding for the year 2019. Kwese Sports are Rugby Africa’s leading partner.

Rugby Africa will advise on alternative format if feasible.
