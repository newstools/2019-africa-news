                            A research delegation from Denmark visited Ghana to see the field sites of four Danida funded projects.



The port of Tema is the focus point of a maritime research project between Denmark and Ghana. Representatives from a Danish research delegation visited the port on Friday for a guided tour.

The research project is titled ‘Port Efficiency and Public Private Capacity’ (PEPP) and have received a 4.997.029DKK grant under the Danida support to development research. Annette Skovsted Hansen from Aarhus University will coordinate the project in collaboration with Business School University of Ghana.

Grants to Ghana
The PEPP project aims to map and improve approaches to capacity development for the maritime sector in Ghana. Better capacity development can help drive Ghana’s economic growth in a sustainable manners. The project is closely linked to the strategic sector cooperation between Ghana Maritime Authority, Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority, and the Danish Maritime Authority on the maritime environment in Ghana.

The trip to Tema Port was part of a five-day programme where the delegation travelled around Ghana to visit four of the new projects granted under the Danida support to development research. The four projects are: a responsible business project in Legon, a climate change project in Accra, a maritime project in Cape Coast, and the PEPP project. 

Every year Danida provides grants for development research projects and 2018 turned out to be a good year for Ghana: Six out of the 23 grants were given to projects in Ghana.

The Tema Port project will run until 2022.
