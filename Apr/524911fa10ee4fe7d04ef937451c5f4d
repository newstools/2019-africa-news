TOKYO, Japan, April 11, 2019/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            Japan is deeply concerned that violence has been claiming many lives and caused injuries in the neighborhood of Tripoli on 5 April and afterwards.



Japan calls on all parties concerned to stop immediately all military operations. There is no military solution to the conflict in Libya.

Japan believes that the process of the political process in which all parties participate is indispensable to the stability of Libya. Japan will support the UN-led political process in order to realize it, and cooperate with efforts of the international community.
