                            The generosity of Canadians in times of crisis is always remarkable, and their efforts are making a difference in the lives of vulnerable populations.

The Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister of International Development and Minister for Women and Gender Equality, today announced that for every donation made by individual Canadians to Canadaâ€™s Humanitarian Coalition and its members between March 15 and April 14, 2019, the Government of Canada will contribute an equivalent amount to the Humanitarian Coalition, up to a maximum total of $2 million.

The minister also took the opportunity to announce an additional contribution of $4.5 million, focussing on health and food security, to other humanitarian partners responding to the crisis in southern Africa.

Concerted humanitarian action is required to meet the needs of populations affected by Tropical Cyclone Idai in southern Africa. The situation on the ground remains critical, and households displaced by flooding or otherwise impacted by the storm are in immediate need of food, shelter, water, sanitation, health care and protection for the most vulnerable.

Canada continues to monitor the situation and remains in close contact with all of its partners to determine the best way to respond to this crisis. In collaboration with the Humanitarian Coalition, the Matching Fund is an important mechanism that will help Canada deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance.
