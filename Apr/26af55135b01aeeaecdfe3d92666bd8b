                            The 2nd Ethio-Brazil Trade and Investment Forum was held on Thursday last week (March 28) at the World Trade Centre, Sao Paulo. The Forum, organized by WAFA Marketing and Promotion PLC and the São Paulo World Trade Centre, brought together nearly a hundred private sector business representatives, 80 from Brazil, as well as dozens of other interested participants.



Opening the Forum, Ambassador Yalew Abate, Ethiopia’s Ambassador to Brazil noted that despite more than half a century of diplomatic relations there had been no strong growth in trade and investment between the two countries. He said bilateral relations had to be translated into meaningful economic ties between their business communities. He strongly advised members of the private sectors of each country to spearhead activities to boost trade and stressed the readiness of the Embassy to support potential investors in Ethiopia.
