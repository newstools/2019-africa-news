                            Freshworks (www.Freshworks.com), a global leader in customer engagement software, has integrated its customer engagement suite with the WhatsApp Business solution to offer on-the-go conversational support via WhatsApp. Over 1.5 billion people from 180 countries use WhatsApp to stay in touch with friends, family and businesses, anytime and anywhere.



Freshworks now helps businesses efficiently manage and route user conversations happening on WhatsApp and other channels, via Omniroute™, Freshworks’ patent-pending technology (bit.ly/2UwEdQF) within the Freshworks customer engagement suite. Omniroute™ provides customer service agents with a unified view of customer inquiries regardless of channel and helps them respond to those inquiries more efficiently. What results is better customer service and more efficient support through WhatsApp and the rich variety of other seamlessly integrated channels in the Freshworks platform.



WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and private way to talk to anyone in the world. The WhatsApp Business solution helps businesses and customers connect quickly and easily. With the Freshworks integration, users can now reach out to businesses with any query, directly on WhatsApp, so businesses can immediately respond and offer support.

Freshworks recently launched Proximity (bit.ly/2DrPRXo), a set of features for Freshchat, their modern messaging software to bring businesses closer to users. The integration with the WhatsApp Business solution further fulfills this promise while giving businesses the power to manage conversations at scale. Responses can be text, images, GIFs, attachments or even canned responses. The Freshchat dashboard provides separate insights on WhatsApp conversations, like chat volume and productivity within the WhatsApp channel. The integration is already available in four continents leveraged by support and sales functions across verticals like e-commerce, media, travel, and finance.



“Users no longer have to jump through hoops to reach out to a business - all they have to do is flip out their mobile and engaging with their favorite brand is just a message away on WhatsApp,” says Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshworks. “Omnichannel customer engagement is becoming the imperative to providing great customer support. The integration with the enormously popular WhatsApp platform enables customers and prospects to get in touch with businesses instantly, offering support through this widely used medium of choice.”



Supr Daily (www.SuprDaily.com), a direct to home dairy products delivery service in India, uses the Freshchat integration with the WhatsApp Business solution to broaden its customer support opportunities. “Today’s customer wants a convenient way to reach out to brands. WhatsApp is a user-friendly way to communicate; as such, it’s also the easiest way for many of our customers to reach out to us.” says Tarkeshwar Singh, Senior Product Manager at Supr Daily. “We actively promote WhatsApp as a medium to connect with us and we now see about half of our customers use it for support queries. The Freshworks integration made it possible for us to provide great quality and quick support to our customers, which is indispensable in our business.”
