LILONGWE, Malawi, April 9, 2019/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The Irish Government has directly allocated some MWK615 million (€750,000) in response to the recent flooding in Malawi.



Irish Ambassador to Malawi Gerry Cunningham said:

“I am delighted that through our NGO partners, all of whom are working closely with district officials, our funds have provided immediate relief to many of the affected families, while the cash transfers and planting materials will support them to take advantage wherever possible of the short opportunity available through winter cropping”.

Ireland has provided K287 million to Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, and Trocaire to provide shelter; water and sanitation; cash transfers; and in particular to support health and nutrition for women and children across some of the worst affected areas in Chikwawa, Nsanje, and Zomba

Ireland has also provided K328 million to Save the Children to support 5,500 households in Zomba to address immediate needs through cash transfers, but also to promote an early recovery wherever feasible by providing planting material for winter cropping.

Irish Aid’s country strategy focuses in particular on climate sensitive agricultural diversification, as well as building the resilience of Malawi to better plan and respond to disasters, including though the innovative use of cash transfers to protect the most vulnerable.

Ireland was already working with Ministry of Gender providing a monthly social cash transfer and a lean season top-up to 22,500 families in Balaka and Ntcheu. While in Neno, through Save the Children, Ireland has just provided K316 million (€386,000) to 4,000 households for cash transfers; orange flesh sweet potato vines; and also for fuel efficient cook-stoves to reduce deforestation.

The Ambassador said that:

“This additional K615 million builds on our ongoing annual support in agriculture and social protection to address the adverse effects of climate change and other shocks”.

This direct funding from the Irish Government complements Irelands ongoing support through multilateral and NGO channels including the UN Central Emergency Response Fund; European Union emergency funding; and the START network which provided an earlier rapid funding response to other NGOs including HelpAge and GOAL.
