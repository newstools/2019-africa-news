                            The European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed a commitment of USD 15 million with the SPE Africa Industrialization I Fund (AIF I), a generalist private equity fund targeting primarily growth capital investments in SMEs and mid-market companies mainly in North Africa, with a focus on Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. The fund’s first closing reached USD 80 million.



The fund manager, SPE Capital Partners, will adopt a hands-on value-adding investment strategy and will seek to acquire equity stakes in enterprises with robust growth potential in important sectors such as education, healthcare, manufacturing and services to meet their investment needs.
