BRUSSELS, Belgium, April 8, 2019/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            Since 19 December, peaceful demonstrations have taken place in Sudan. Over the last two days, the Sudanese citizens have come out in unprecedented numbers, calling for change. 

The European Union expects that the call for change will prompt a commitment to a peaceful, credible, legitimate and inclusive process that will allow Sudan to carry out essential reforms. These should guarantee the economic security and political representation that the people of Sudan deserve and expect, while providing assurances for the stability of Sudan’s neighbours.

To secure the confidence of Sudanese citizens and many of Sudan’s international partners this process should begin now. Peaceful demonstrations should be permitted. Security forces should not use tear gas and live ammunition against peaceful protesters. Political prisoners should be released. 

The people of Sudan have shown remarkable resilience in the face of extraordinary obstacles over many years. Their trust must be won through concrete action by the government.
