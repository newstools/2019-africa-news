Two Frenchwomen, Commander Séverine and Captain Lorianne, will follow a yearly training course dedicated to female officers only, at the International Peace Support Training Center in Nairobi. The training is jointly organized with UN-Women until 12 April.

The 40 trainees of the Female Military Officer Course will get familiar with the structures and rules of Peacekeeping Operations of the United Nations, before being deployed on the ground as part of the Blue Helmets forces in the year following the training.
                                The training is jointly organized with UN-Women until 12 April
                            

Beyond engagement and use of force rules, the trainees are also expected to acquire theoretical and practical knowledge necessary to efficiently implement UN policies and directives in the context of a Blue Helmets deployment.

The training also explores gender issues, including all forms of sexual and gender-related violence to which the soldiers could be exposed on the ground, so as to help them protect women, children and vulnerable groups on the ground, but also for their own protection.

All in all, this multi-dimension training course provides a better overall understanding of peacekeeping operation, both of their purely military and assistance-to-populations perspectives.

We wish our trainees a fruitful stay in Nairobi.

Karibuni Kenya!
