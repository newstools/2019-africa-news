                            The United Nations Egypt in partnership with the Ministry of Social Solidarity, RiseUp, and PepsiCo are organizing a three-day Hackathon where 21 teams of youth aged between 18-29 will compete to offer innovative digital solutions designed to tackle two of Egypt’s national development priorities and Sustainable Development Goals, Zero Hunger and Gender Equality.

The United Nations, represented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), UN Women, and the World Food Programme (WFP), will support the competing youth throughout the Hackathon with mentorship programs and technical sessions on achieving the two goals. Participants will be introduced to information, opportunities and challenges as well as programs targeting Zero Hunger and Gender Equality.

Teams will present their digital solutions to expert panels and on the final day, a panel of judges including the United Nations Resident Coordinator Richard Dictus, Her Excellency Minister of Social Solidarity Ghada Waly and CEO of Pepsico Mohamed Shelbaya will select a winner from three finalists.

“Egypt’s youth are a creative, solution-oriented force,” said Richard Dictus, “it is essential to continue forming these kinds of partnerships that include youth, the private sector, the Egyptian government and the United Nations in order to succeed in achieving the development agenda.”

Pepsico will award the winners a sum of EGP 500,000 to support the implementation of their project.
