At the invitation of the President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, the Governor General will attend the ceremony for the 25th commemoration of the Genocide against the Tutsi. During an official ceremony, she will lay a wreath to honour the more than 800,000 victims – Tutsis, moderate Hutus, and others.

Canada recognizes the members of the UN peace support mission in Rwanda, including Canadian peacekeepers and General Roméo Dallaire, who risked their lives to save others and protect those seeking refuge. We remain committed to working with partners to promote international human rights and prevent atrocities like this from ever happening again.

During the visit, the Governor General will also tour the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, to underline the importance of promoting STEM-related careers for young people so that they are prepared for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
