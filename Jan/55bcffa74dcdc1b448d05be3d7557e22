PRETORIA, South Africa, January 7, 2019/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            South Africa joins SADC, the AU and many other international organisations in awaiting the elections results to be announced by the  Democratic  Republic of Congo's (DRC) Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI). Any other body of civil society should refrain from announcing  any results of the  elections which may undermine peace and stability in the DRC, as well as multilateral processes. We urge all leaders from different sectors of society to be responsible and wait for the elections results from CENI.
