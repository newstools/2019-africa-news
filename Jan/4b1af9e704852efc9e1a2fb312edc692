Accompanied by the district inspectors for Malabo and Baney, he declared his concern regarding the various complaints presented regarding some teachers who, at the start of the second term, are not respecting the assigned timetables.



In addition to reminding them of the role they play in society, he commented on their irresponsibility, and stated that, from the time of this meeting, the public centres would be supported, and there would be checks at each centre to check on attendance.
