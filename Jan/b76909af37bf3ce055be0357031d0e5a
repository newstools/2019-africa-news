                            Ensuring that the digital divide is bridged and that broadband networks and services attain the highest level national coverage and use is a priority for the government. It is also worth noting that the growing reliance on digital technologies while creating significant opportunities for innovation, convenience and efficiency comes with digital security and privacy protection risk. In light of these rousing developments Deputy Minister of Communications Pinky Kekana will unveil various digital services at four public facilities in Vhembe District in Limpopo.





The Digital services include, the rolling out of broadband services at four sites and the donation of ICT equipment to 3 (three) schools as well as a comprehensive cyber-security outreach program. The Deputy Minister will be joined by the MEC of Education in Limpopo Mr Ishmael Kgetjepe.
