WASHINGTON D.C., United States of America, January 11, 2019/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The United States takes note of the National Independent Electoral Commission's announcement of the provisional results of December 30 elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We congratulate the millions of courageous voters who went to the polls across DRC to cast their ballots after two years of delay. Many of these voters waited long hours for the chance to make their voices heard. Many other voters were unable to vote due to challenges with the organization of polling stations, missing election materials, or the cancellation of elections in the Ebola affected areas of Beni and Butembo, yet still found creative, peaceful, and inspirational ways to express their desire for a more peaceful and prosperous Congo. The United States stands with the people of Congo at this historic moment and it is they who should determine their countryâ€™s future.

The United States also notes the importance of President Joseph Kabila's decision to abide by his constitutionally mandated term limits and transfer power to a successor. The National Independent Electoral Commission has announced provisional results, but we await clarification of questions which have been raised regarding the electoral count. The United States notes that stakeholders have the option to request a review of the announced provisional results to ensure they reflect the will of the Congolese people as expressed through the ballot box. We urge all stakeholders to remain calm as the process continues. Violence is unacceptable, and the U.S. Government will hold accountable those who perpetrate election-related violence or impede the democratic process.
