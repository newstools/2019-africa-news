YPO EDGE is YPO’s annual showcase of thought leadership and innovation, bringing together visionaries, talented leaders, subject matter experts and unique voices from around the world to engage and inspire all that attend this invitation-only event.

YPO EDGE presents a very tangible way to showcase our country and the exciting future we have ahead of us to some of the world’s most influential business leaders.” 



During a time of radical economic, technological, and societal change, leadership methods are being redefined and retooled to adapt for the future. The theme of this year’s YPO EDGE, Life of RE_, aims to provide opportunities, support and inspiration for young leaders as they reinvent themselves and their industries.

“We are purposefully reinvesting in the local community as a way to thank our host city,” added YPO EDGE Chair Ravi Naidoo. “We hope this important initiative will have both a positive impact and a lasting legacy on Langa long after the grateful leaders of YPO have left our shores.” 



Beverley Schäfer, Minister of Economic Opportunities in the Western Cape said: “We are delighted to be hosting the YPO EDGE delegates in Cape Town this year. The conference will give us an opportunity to showcase Cape Town and the rest of our province as a tourism, events and investment destination to a network of chief executives and thought leaders from around the globe. As a province, our focus has been on growing an economy for the future with a focus on tech, innovation and the green economy. This year’s theme of the Life of Re_ is perfectly aligned to our focus on reskilling, redefining and recycling, and I believe the YPO delegates will find a lot to be excited about here.” 



Paul Berman further shares, “We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to present South Africa to this group of business leaders and demonstrate, after a period of adverse international publicity, how we are overcoming our challenges. We have a chance to show that we are a nation at one, committed to work, to build, to change and to progress.”
