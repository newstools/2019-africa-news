The Government of Japan offers scholarships to international students who wish to study in postgraduate, undergraduate, and other programs at Japanese universities. The aim of these scholarships is to promote international exchange, thus enhance Japan’s relationship with other countries, and contribute to human resource development in the sending countries. Japan annually receives about 2 to 3 students from Zambia through the Japanese Government’s Scholarship Program.



As the Annual Assembly provides an opportunity for the strengthening of Japan Scholars Association to develop the networks among its members and vitalize the activities of the Association, it is expected to contribute to the consolidation of the friendly relationship between Japan and Zambia.
