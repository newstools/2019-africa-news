GENEVA, Switzerland, February 6, 2019/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            The LuQuLuQu campaign, an initiative of UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is organising a public walk in solidarity with families forced to flee their homes across Africa. The #StepForSafety walk will take place in Johannesburg, South Africa at the Walter Sisulu National Botanical Gardens.
 
Africa hosts the highest number of forcibly displaced persons – over 24 million. In raising awareness of the plight of refugees, #StepForSafety draws attention to the perilous journeys refugees have taken to find safety. 
 
Participants will have the choice of three routes which they can walk, run or jog – including a stroller friendly option. Following the walk, attendees will have an opportunity to walk the steps of a person forced to flee in an experiential simulation of a UNHCR reception centre, refugee registration process, distribution on non-food items and refugee shelter, all designed to build first-hand knowledge of the refugee experience. 
 
There will also be a market with a variety of food, arts and craft stalls as well as post-walk performances and appearances from ANATII, Tresor Riziki, Ma Nala, Ayanda Makayi, Ancillar Mangena; Edith Venter; UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Leanne Manas and many more.
