                            The 2019 #EnterpriseCup Preliminary round had three out of eight matches actually kick off in their various venues. At the RFUEA Grounds, hosts Kenya Harlequin scored 80 points against the opponents Ngong Warriors while only conceding three. At the Madaraka Grounds, Strathmore Leos secured their spot in the Pre-quarters as they beat the JKUAT Cougars 59-15 while Mombasa Sports Club hosted what turned out to be one hotly contested match between the Regional Logistics Mombasa RFC and Moi University.



At the breather, Mombasa were trailing Moi 13 points to 19 but a converted try in the second half awarded the hosts the much needed win. Kisumu, Menengai Oilers, Mean Machine, Kisii RFC and Western Bulls all benefited from their walkovers booking themselves slots in the pre-quarters round come 9th March.
