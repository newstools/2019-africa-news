We expect to see high levels of competition in this year's league emanating from the fact that last season ended on an unprecedented note. So far, some of the friendly games played this year are Ndola vs Roan, Roan vs Buffaloes, Mufulira vs Eagles, KPF vs Roan, Mufulira vs Chibuluma and Lusaka Mini 15s Tournament played across the country.



"The league which is set to end on 19th October, 2019 will see a number of games both local and International being played by both the experienced and upcoming players who have so far shown alot of hunger and determination to raise the bar", He concluded.
