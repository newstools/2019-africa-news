We commend President Faustin Archange Touad√©ra and the armed group leaders for choosing the path of peace. The United States congratulates the African Union and MINUSCA for their personal engagement in, and commitment to, the Central African peace process.

Considerable challenges lie ahead as Central Africans strive for peace. As this process moves forward, the United States will work with all parties, in partnership with the international community, to advance peace, security, and stability in the Central African Republic
