According to U.S. Charge d’Affaires Thomas Goldberger, “It’s been a great pleasure to meet the amazing Egyptian entrepreneurs who have participated in past Global Entrepreneurship Summits.  I look forward to meeting what I am sure will be a strong Egypt team attending this year’s Summit and exploring how we can work with them, the Egyptian government and the private sector to continue to encourage innovation and economic growth to benefit all Egyptians.”



Approximately 2,000 participants will be invited to this year’s summit, including 1,200 entrepreneurs, 400 investors, and 400 thought leaders and other officials from all over the world. GES 2019 will feature the following five focus areas for innovation: (1) agriculture, (2) connectivity, (3) energy, (4) health, and (5) water. During two days of (delete dynamic) discussions, pitch competitions, and matchmaking sessions, GES 2019 will showcase inspiring entrepreneurs, new collaborations and opportunities for investments, the development of concrete business ideas, and the acceleration of solutions to global challenges.



GES will provide food and accommodations for three nights in The Hague for entrepreneurs attending the summit at the World Forum.  Most entrepreneurs will need to self-fund other travel costs and related expenses to and from the Netherlands. Travel scholarships are available for a limited number of entrepreneurs based on need. Other invitees, including investors, will need to self-fund travel, visa, and accommodation costs. Please contact the U.S. Embassy if you are an established investor who would like to self-fund and attend. (Contact: Abi Olvera - OlveraAA@state.gov)
