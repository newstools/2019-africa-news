GENEVA, Switzerland, February 27, 2019/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            Tunisia has requested WTO dispute consultations with Morocco concerning final anti-dumping duties imposed by Morocco on imports of school exercise books from Tunisia. The request was circulated to WTO members on 27 February.



Tunisia claims that Morocco acted inconsistently with a number of provisions under the WTO's Anti-Dumping Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994.  Tunisia initiated a separate WTO dispute complaint last July regarding Morocco's decision to impose preliminary duties on the school exercise books.

What is a request for consultations?

The request for consultations formally initiates a dispute in the WTO. Consultations give the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter and to find a satisfactory solution without proceeding further with litigation. After 60 days, if consultations have failed to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel.
