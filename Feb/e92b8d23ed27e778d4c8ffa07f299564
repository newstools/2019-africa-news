These recommendations are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce and license influenza vaccines.

On 21 February 2019, the recommendations on the composition of the influenza vaccines for the following 2019-2010 influenza season will be publicly announced in an Information Meeting at the same venue in Beijing.
