                            Three leading universities in Egypt will partner with American universities to create Centers of Excellence in energy, water, and agriculture. Supported by an investment of $90 million through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the three Centers will establish linkages between Egyptian universities and leading universities in the United States, help forge relationships between Egyptian and American researchers and experts, and drive research and innovation in sectors that are key to Egypt’s future economic growth.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will partner with Ain Shams University to establish a Center of Excellence in Energy. Cornell University in New York will partner with Cairo University to create a Center of Excellence in Agriculture. The American University in Cairo will partner with Alexandria University to develop a Center of Excellence in Water.



“The Centers will facilitate meaningful collaboration between American and Egyptian universities, as well as to serve the critical needs of industry and government in applied research and policy development in these sectors,” said USAID Mission Director Sherry F. Carlin. “They will bring together some of the best minds to collectively address shared goals and challenges, spur innovative thinking, encourage private sector engagement, and strengthen government policy in the agricultural, water, and energy sectors.”



Since 1978, the American people have invested $30 billion to further Egypt’s human and economic development. To find out more about USAID’s work in Egypt, please see https://www.usaid.gov/egypt, and follow on Facebook and Twitter at @USAIDEgypt
