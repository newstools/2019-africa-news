Even in todayâ€™s world of digital communications, radio reaches more people than any other media platform.



It conveys vital information and raises awareness on important issues.



And it is a personal, interactive platform where people can air their views, concerns, and grievances. Radio can create a community.



For the United Nations, especially our peacekeeping operations, radio is a vital way of informing, reuniting and empowering people affected by war.



On this World Radio Day, let us recognize the power of radio to promote dialogue, tolerance and peace.



Thank you.
