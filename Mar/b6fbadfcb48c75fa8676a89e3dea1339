                            The Government of Japan congratulates H.E. Mr. Macky SALL on his reelection in the presidential election of the Republic of Senegal.



It is of great significance that the presidential election was held in a peaceful and democratic manner and thereby reconfirmed Senegalese tradition of mature democracy which shows an example of a democratic state in Africa.

Japan will host the G20 Osaka Summit and TICAD7 this year. The Government of Japan will continue to address global challenges together with Senegal, an important partner for Japan, and is willing to extend its support for the efforts of the Senegalese Government led by President Macky SALL towards the country’s development.
