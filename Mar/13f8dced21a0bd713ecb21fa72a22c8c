                            Get into the spirit of Earth Hour with family or friends by taking part in an orienteering-style adventure dash in one of South Africa’s most beautiful national botanical gardens.

Following on two successive years of successful ‘dashes’, WWF will again be hosting Earth Hour Adventure events at the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden in Cape Town and, for the first time, in the Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden in Roodepoort, Johannesburg.

The events, which are particularly popular with families, will kick off at 6pm on 30 March 2019 and once the “dash” commences, participants will navigate their way by headlamps to hidden check points dotted across a 5km course in the gardens.
