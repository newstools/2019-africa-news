VALLETTA, Malta, March 29, 2019/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            With reference to press reports claiming that Malta has announced a visa waiver policy for Ghanaian passport holders, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade Promotion would like to clarify the following:
                                This process is yet to be concluded
                            



On 26 March 2019, Malta and Ghana signed an Agreement on the Waiver of Visa Requirements for Holders of Diplomatic and Official/Service Passports. The agreement, waivering the requirement for a visa only for holders of such passports, will enter into force following the notification by both parties (Malta and Ghana) of the completion of the necessary national legal procedures. This process is yet to be concluded.

It is therefore clear that Schengen regulations and the requirement of a visa for Ghanaian nationals, holders of normal passports, to travel to and enter into Malta, is still in force.
