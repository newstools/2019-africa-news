"I condemn the violence against innocent civilians in central Mali over the weekend. I encourage the Government of Mali to redouble effort to ensure peace and stability in Central Mali and to protect vulnerable populations from such attacks.  Those who perpetrate such terrible crimes must be brought to justice."
