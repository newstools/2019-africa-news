                            The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) deplores the massacre that occurred on 23 March 2019 in the village of Ogossagou, in central Mali, where more than 100 civilians were killed and others wounded by armed men.

"It's heartbreaking how young some victims were, between one and three years old. It's also sadly striking that the majority of the wounded were women," said FÃ©lix Santhoni, an ICRC delegate who was at Mopti hospital when the wounded arrived.
                                The ICRC calls on all actors to exercise restraint, respect civilians and spare fighters who have stopped fighting
                            

"What happened in Ogossagou is extremely worrying. The ICRC deplores these totally unacceptable acts and is worried about the exacerbation of inter-communal tensions in central Mali. Such actions worsen an already fragile security situation and have serious humanitarian consequences. The ICRC calls on all actors to exercise restraint, respect civilians and spare fighters who have stopped fighting," said Jean-Nicolas Marti, the head of the ICRC delegation in Mali.

In coordination with health officials in the region, the ICRC helped to evacuate the wounded to the Mopti Regional Hospital. The ICRC also donated medical equipment to the hospital in Mopti.

In recent months, the ICRC has strengthened its presence in central Mali by bringing aid to the populations most affected by armed conflict and violence, including medical supplies at the Mopti regional hospital and emergency assistance to displaced persons.
