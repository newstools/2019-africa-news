Clemens Kröger is a concert pianist, chamber musician and music arranger. Daniel Sorour is a renowned cellist, lecturer and jury member of “Jugend musiziert”: a German music project aimed at promoting music among the youth. Their concerts have already taken them to countries around the World such as Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, Lebanon, Cuba and the USA.

The contrast between well-known pieces and modern arrangements are a big part of the charm and success of “The Modern Cello-Piano Duo”: refined classical melodies by for example Franz Schubert meet modern rock classics by Queen and Nirvana. Other highlights are provided by pieces by Niccolo Paganini or Manuel de Falla.

During the course of the programme, the musicians will inform the spectators about the different composers and their pieces. “The Modern Cello-Piano Duo” will whisk you away into the wide world of cello and piano music. With esprit and virtuosity, they will create a unique evening of music. Do not miss it!
