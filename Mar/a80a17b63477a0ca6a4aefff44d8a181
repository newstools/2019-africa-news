                            To commemorate Women’s History Month, Embassy Yaounde welcomed forty pupils from Groupe Scolaire Bilingue La Grace, for a “Drop Everything and Read” session. The pupils were excited to meet Ambassador Peter Henry Barlerin, who encouraged them to study hard. Education empowers people to make better choices and is important for the personal, social and economic development of the community. Using ARS’ Nouveaux Horizons book,  “Malala: a Brave Girl from Pakistan” by Jeannette Winter, the children took turns reading about the tragic, yet inspiring events that propelled the young Pakistani girl to international fame. The children understood the right to education and its role in their development.
