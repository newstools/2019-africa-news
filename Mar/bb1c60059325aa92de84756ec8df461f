Thank you, Madame Vice-President,


                                We therefore encourage Mauritius to take urgent steps to address gender-based violence by strengthening investigations, prosecutions and convictions
                            

The United Kingdom welcomes Mauritius’s continued engagement in the UPR process.

We recognise the positive steps taken by Mauritius to further strengthen partnership between governments, civil society and the business sector to eliminate forced and bonded labour from supply chains in Mauritius.

We acknowledge Mauritius’s amendments to the Protection from Domestic Violence Act in 2016 but note that the current report figures reflect concerning levels of gender-based violence, and that the problem is under reported. We therefore encourage Mauritius to take urgent steps to address gender-based violence by strengthening investigations, prosecutions and convictions, and by introducing public information campaigns to encourage victims to report such crimes and to deter further offences.

We regret that Mauritius could not accept our recommendation of an open, merit-based selection process when selecting national candidates for UN Treaty Body elections and hope they will reconsider their position.

Thank you, Madame Vice-President.
