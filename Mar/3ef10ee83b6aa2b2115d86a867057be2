HARARE, Zimbabwe, March 24, 2019/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            Zimbabwe’s senior men’s and women’s sides entertained home fans with convincing wins to top both their groups at the end of day one of the Kwese Sevens Tournament on the Machinery Exchange Stadium at Harare Sports Club



Zambezi Cheetahs were the sauce of the day with a brilliant 36-12 victory over Zambia to finish on top of Group A which see them facing Malawi in Sunday’s quarter-final.



This was prior to a flawless 30-0 win over the Spartans from Botswana much to coach Gilbert Nyamutsamba’s delight.



“I am very happy with how the boys came together in both matches, together with the way Goshawks had won two out. of three matches is good.

“This was an important day for us to have a look at the areas we need to work on and the final day will be another chance in front of our home crowd to play some good rugby,” said Nyamutsamba.



Lady Cheetahs had a clean sheet beating Zambia, Zimbabwe A and Zim Southern Sevens which means they will in their afternoon semi-finals as favourites.



Coach Abigail Kawonza said she will push her charges to up the ante as they aim for the cup.



“It was a good day for the girls who put in a lot of hard work today but I will drive them to give us more because I know what they are capable of.

“There will be tougher games this year and we have to always condition ourselves to prepare for that, I am happy that the crowd was screaming for them and seeing what we are capable of,” said Kawonza.



Lesotho were not able to make it to the tournament as they had break-downs on their way and fixtures had to be adjusted.
