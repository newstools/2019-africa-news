                            During his visit to Egypt, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Mark Green launched a $37 million project to enhance productivity across Egypt’s entire agricultural value chain, beginning on the farm and extending to when products reach consumers.

The “Feed the Future” project helps farmers in Upper Egypt become more self-reliant and grow marketable crops for export that meet international standards. Egyptian farmers and food processors will establish connections to domestic and international markets, gain access to financing, and increase their compliance to food and safety standards. The project also helps agribusinesses modernize food technology and delivery systems by upgrading processing facilities, refrigeration trucks, and water-efficient irrigation systems.



Speaking in Esna, USAID Administrator Mark Green said, “At USAID, helping our partners to improve agricultural productivity is one of our highest priorities, because advancing food security is an essential path to prosperity and self-reliance.”
