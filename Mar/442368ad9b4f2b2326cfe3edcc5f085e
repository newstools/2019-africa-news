PRETORIA, South Africa, March 18, 2019/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            Through Access UK, customers are now able to book their visa application centre appointment, scan and upload their supporting documentation from the comfort of their own home, and purchase any additional services which are intended to enhance their experience in one continuous journey.



Customers can continue to upload documents to support their application up until the day of their appointment. This exciting development means that the majority of customers no longer have to submit their original documentation, though customers will still need to provide their passport in order for a vignette to be placed, should they be granted a visa.
