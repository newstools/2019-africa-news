The Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) is joining the nation in charitable work to support victims of Cyclone Idai that largely affected the eastern province of Manicaland.

Cyclone Idai which has been recorded as one of the worst Tropical Cyclones to have affected the Southern Hemisphere affecting more than 2,6 million people in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi.
                                We are joining every Zimbabwean in the collective humanitarian efforts across all platforms to help those affected by the cyclone
                            

As the ZRU we have partnered with Econet Wireless in a joint effort to reach out to as many affected people as possible and will donate 5% of our gate takings from the Kwese Sevens Tournament which takes place on Saturday March 23 and Sunday March 24 of March at the Machinery Exchange Stadium at Harare Sports Club.

We are joining every Zimbabwean in the collective humanitarian efforts across all platforms to help those affected by the cyclone.
