MAPUTO, Mozambique, March 19, 2019/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The U.S. Embassy in Mozambique expresses its deepest condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives over the past week due to catastrophic flooding and severe weather related to Cyclone Idai. The People of the United States stand with the People of Mozambique, and the U.S. Government continues to work closely with the Government of the Republic of Mozambique and partner nations and organizations to mitigate the impact of what is still an ongoing natural disaster. The United States is mobilizing to provide support for the Mozambican government’s disaster response activities and is committed to providing our Mozambican partners with the resources required to alleviate the suffering of those impacted by these twin disasters.



Our thoughts are with those who have lost their homes, their livelihoods, and most of all, their loved ones.
