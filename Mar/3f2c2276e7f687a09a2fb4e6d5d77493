                            Statement by Michael R. Pompeo



Today marks 40 years since Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin met at the White House and took a courageous step in choosing peace. Following the Camp David Accords, the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty laid the foundation for a new chapter in the Middle East. This crowning diplomatic achievement was the result of years of intense negotiations and remains a shining example of what can be achieved through honest dialogue, collaborative diplomacy, and moral courage. Not only did the treaty open the door to increased U.S. partnership with Egypt, it also set the stage for a safer, more stable, better integrated region, ending a long period of armed conflict.

We take the opportunity today to celebrate the progress we have made and to emphasize our unwavering dedication to pursuing a more comprehensive peace in the region that respects the dignity and security of all involved.
