"This song has the ambition to become a hymn for the entire African continent," says RedOne. "My wish is that all Africans will find themselves in this song which represents my modest contribution to this continent that I love and which I am proud to belong to".

The last title of RedOne "We love Africa" was chosen to be the official song that will accompany the 12th edition of Pan-African Games 2019 in Rabat.

The launch of the song was shared on stage with the audience during the opening night of this 12th edition.
