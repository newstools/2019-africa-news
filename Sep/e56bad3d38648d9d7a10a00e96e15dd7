“Abdirashid Janan is accused by the UN Somalia and Eritrea Monitoring Group of horrific crimes including killings, torture, unlawful detention and illegal renditions between 2014 and 2015. The authorities must immediately bring him before a civilian court to face trial in accordance with international fair trial standards.

“The investigation and trial of Abdirashid Janan must usher in an era of justice for victims of human rights violations and their families in Somalia.”
