LET’S GET CREATIVE 

Want to ‘wow’ the board with a smart presentation but the deadline is today? No problem! Need to print out agendas for your upcoming sales conference? Simple! Try eye-catching formats using fancy folds, print on thicker paper for a more ‘premium’ look and feel, or use textured paper for impact. It’s now easier for you to print a wider range of materials.

For consumers who’ve left a potential purchase lingering in their virtual shopping basket, a bespoke direct mail piece and a personalised printed envelope can nudge them along to purchase. Money in the bank and brand loyalty points for you, double win. Or a small action like having handouts targeted for your audience, with a professional-looking finish, could seal the deal and win you that pitch.

Somesh Adukia explains “We’re all customers, so we all need to think ‘What makes me want to engage with a brand?’ This is where creative print can make a real difference. The physicality of print awakens the senses and smart personalisation can inspire action. In this digital age, print can drive engagement. You can experience the positive impact in your business and see how it helps to deliver that all-important ROI.”
