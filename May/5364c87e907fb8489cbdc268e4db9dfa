The UPR is a unique process which involves a periodic review of the human rights records of all 193 UN Member States. Since its first meeting was held in April 2008, all 193 UN member States have been reviewed twice within the first and second UPR cycles. During the third UPR cycle, States are again expected to spell out steps they have taken to implement recommendations posed during their previous reviews which they committed to follow-up on, as well as to highlight recent human rights developments in the country.



The delegation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be headed by Mr. Zénon Mukongo Ngay, Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva.



The three country representatives serving as rapporteurs (“troika”) for the review of Cambodia are: Cameroon, Qatar and Croatia.
