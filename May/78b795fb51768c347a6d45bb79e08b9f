The aim of the EUTM-S Train-the-Trainers course is to build a cadre of SNA instructors who will be able to gradually create a self-sustaining, independent and indigenous training capability in the SNA. The course includes modules covering leadership, military tactics, crowd control, instructional techniques and human rights.

A number of dignitaries joined EUTM-S Mission Force Commander Brigadier General Matteo Spreafico for the ceremony, including the SNA Chief of the Staff Major General Abdi Assan Mohamed, SNA GDTC Commander Brigadier General Mohamed Mohamud Saney and Deputy Land Force Commander Abdi Abdullabhi Shere.

EUTM-S was established in 2010 and works in partnership with the SNA and the Ministry of Defence to build the capacity of Somali defence institutions, using a ‘Three Pillar Approach’ of Training, Advising and Mentoring.
