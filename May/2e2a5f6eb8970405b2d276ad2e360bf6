This outbreak marks the tenth epidemic of EVD in the DRC. Only a few months after the country declared the end of the 9th EVD outbreak in Equateur province in May 2018, it relapsed into this lingering epidemic which has been lasting for almost 10 months – which is why the international community’s engagement and support are all the more needed.



This cash assistance from the ROK government will be used funding the Strategic Response Plan 3.0 (SRP-3), devised by the Ministry of Health of the DRC in collaboration with 15 international organizations, including WHO.



The ROK government has actively participated in the international efforts to curb the spread of infectious diseases such as Ebola. The past contributions are including, but not limited to, the dispatch of the Korea Disaster Relief Team (KDRT) in 2014 to fight the EVD outbreak in West Africa, and the cash assistance of a total of 1.5 million USD – of which 1m USD for WHO’s CFE (Contingency Fund for Emergencies) – in 2018 to address the EVD outbreak in the DRC. The ROK government will continue to make its efforts to tackle the humanitarian crises worldwide
