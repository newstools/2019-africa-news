The successful completion of this election demonstrates that democracy has taken root in South Africa in the past 25 years. Japan expects that South Africa will enjoy further development under the democracy, and continue to contribute to the peace and prosperity of Africa and also to the resolution of global issues that confront the international community.

Japan will host the G20 Osaka Summit and TICAD7 this year. Together with South Africa, a member of G20 and TICAD and an important partner for Japan, the Government of Japan will continue to address regional and global challenges, and is willing to extend its support for the efforts of the Government of South Africa towards the countryâ€™s development.
