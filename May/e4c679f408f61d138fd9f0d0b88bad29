                            Cyclone Kenneth hit the northern coast of Cabo Delgado province in Mozambique on Thursday evening last week. Several towns and communities are heavily damaged. Rains are still continuing, and there are large areas that are flooded, or are at risk of flooding. MSF started Water and Sanitation (WASH) activities in February 2019 in Pemba, the Capital of the Province, and therefore already has a small team present.
                                As a medical organization we feel it is crucial to help the existing health services to resume their activities as soon as possible
                            



Since MSF provided emergency support for the first cyclone (Idai – 14th of March) in the center of Mozambique (Beira), medical and logistical equipment was sent last week to Pemba to anticipate any emergency response. The team in Pemba assessed the area of Macomia and Matemo Island and will further assess different islands where the needs are still unclear.

“Matemo Island is heavily destructed by the cyclone Kenneth, as well as the city of Macomia and its surrounding villages”, explains Danielle Borges, coordinator of the project in Pemba. “We are currently assessing the needs in these hard to reach areas, in order to provide the necessary support. As a medical organization we feel it is crucial to help the existing health services to resume their activities as soon as possible. Today we provided equipment for a diarrhea treatment center in Pemba, as we fear waterborne diseases will occur in the coming days in the affected area. Other activities will be launched very soon.”
