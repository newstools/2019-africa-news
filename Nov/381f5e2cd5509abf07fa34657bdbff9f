WASHINGTON D.C., United States of America, November 28, 2019/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The Agriculture sector provides livelihoods directly to around 55 percent of the population (and three quarters of the poor) and indirectly to a further 15 percent within related value chain functions such as traders, transporters and processors. The Tanzanian government recognizes the centrality of Agriculture to realizing its objectives of socioeconomic development, which are well-articulated in the Second Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP II).





The World Bank cordially invites accredited Members of the Media to cover the launch of the 13th Tanzania Economic Update titled, ‘Transforming Agriculture: Realizing the Potential of Agriculture for Inclusive Growth and Poverty Reduction,’ which makes the case for urgent supportive public policies and spending to help crowd in private sector investment and take advantage of the sector’s transformation which is currently underway.
