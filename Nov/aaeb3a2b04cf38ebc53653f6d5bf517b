With hundreds of fun and colourful design templates to assemble, the free app (iOS and Android), enables users to add a personalised touch to their designs directly from a smartphone with ease. The Creative Park app is an evolution of the online Creative Park (bit.ly/2qEdhFE) web platform, which attracts more than 10 million visitors a year across the globe¹.



With the festive season around the corner, the Creative Park app is ideal for families to test their creative skills, by downloading a design template. Using a compatible Canon PIXMA printer, there’s a template to suit all age groups, whether it’s Christmas decorations, personalised greeting cards, calendars, picture frames, animals or 3D art to name a few. The app also includes educational content to support and stimulate pre or primary school children.

With easy to follow instructions, the Creative Park app makes crafting simple and fun for all the family. The app also enables users to personalise their creations with text and photos. Whether it’s personalised party invitations or birthday banners, it has never been easier to bring paper creations to life.
