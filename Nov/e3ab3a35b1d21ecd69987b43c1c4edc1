Fun and engaging content ensured record-breaking fan-engagement levels across World Rugby and Rugby World Cup digital products and social media platforms as the international federation prioritised reaching a younger audience through platforms including TikTok, Giphy and Snapchat.

Match and non-match video content across World Rugby and Rugby World Cup social platforms delivered more than 2.1 billion views, nearly six times the figure achieved at Rugby World Cup 2015, while engagement rates doubled from 2015 to six per cent as new rugby fans got closer to the action on and off the field.

The Land Rover Rugby World Cup Daily show, published across World Rugby’s digital platforms every morning during the tournament, delighted fans with its fun, light-touch content and was the most viewed daily online show of the year, generating almost 11 million views and achieving high praise from a diverse audience beyond seasoned rugby fans.

Significantly, World Rugby’s investment in content, supported by partners Fifty Digital, Engage Digital Partners, Grabyo and the participating unions, reaped record rewards with World Rugby owned channels delivering more than half of Rugby World Cup content video views on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube globally.

World Rugby Chief Executive Brett Gosper said: “The growth in global engagement, coupled with these record-breaking outcomes overwhelmingly demonstrate the power of rugby to inspire an enormous new global audience as well as a clear appetite of fans to engage with much more than just match content.”

World Rugby Chief Marketing Officer Marissa Pace added: “Our focus on fan-engagement had a dual approach. First, we deepened the existing fan experience for our core audience and second, we turned to the ‘fun’ side of rugby to attract new fans to the sport.

“We wanted Rugby World Cup 2019 to be more than an outstanding rugby tournament, it was an immersive experience that brought a global audience into the heart of the sport. They were with the teams, with the fans, experiencing content that had personality, which played a significant role in 54 per cent of all 2.1 billion video views being accessed via World Rugby channels. Our fresh approach has enabled us to deliver the most digitally-consumed rugby event ever.”
