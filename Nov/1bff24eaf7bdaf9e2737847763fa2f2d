*The Company presents its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). However, management believes that using additional non-GAAP measures will enhance the evaluation of the profitability of the Company and its ongoing operations. Please see Tables 1 and 2 below for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.

Sherif Foda, Chairman of the Board and CEO of NESR said, “We delivered another solid quarter operationally and commercially despite the geopolitical turbulence witnessed in the region. We have diligently worked through the quarter to position NESR in an advantageous position for the coming year. Late in this quarter we have started on several previously announced new projects which will bring a step change to our operations going forward. These projects have required significant effort from the whole organization and I am very proud of the early results we are seeing and very importantly, the positive reaction of our customers to these new startups. The team has done an outstanding job at managing these very complex projects while maintaining rigor on cost and time and are a testament to the depth of ability we have on the ground in these countries.”

Mr. Foda continued, “Amid an uncertain macro outlook globally, the MENA region is going strong and we believe that our customers will continue to invest at an increased pace across the region in both the conventional and unconventional space. We have visibility today on several large unconventional programs across the region which are at different stages of development and these would be adding to the emerging MENA upcycle. These also tie in very well with NESR’s portfolio and the innovative technology and processes we have sourced globally and will enable NESR to be on the leading edge of these developments and generate market leading returns.”

Net Income Results

The Company had net income for the third quarter of 2019 totaling $11.1 million as compared to a net income of $11.3 million for the second quarter of 2019 and $16.2 million in the prior year quarter. Net income decreased year-over-year primarily due to increased depreciation charges. Net income for the third quarter of 2019, second quarter of 2019, and third quarter of 2018, includes amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in the Business Combination, of $3.8 million, $3.8 million, and $3.6 million respectively. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2019 is $16.2 million and includes adjustments totaling $5.1 million mainly related to integration and restructuring costs and other discrete provisions (collectively, “Total Charges and Credits”). A complete list of the adjusting items and associated reconciliation from GAAP has been provided in Table 1 below in the section entitled “Reconciliation of Net Income and Adjusted Net Income for Successor Periods.”

The Company reported $0.13 of diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2019 compared to $0.13 per share during the second quarter 2019 period. Adjusted for the impact of Total Charges and Credits, a non-GAAP measure described in Table 1 below, Adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2019 is $0.19, which is consistent with the second quarter of 2019.

See “Business Combination Accounting and Presentation of Results of Operations” section below for additional information on current reporting conventions.

EBITDA Results

The Company produced Adjusted EBITDA of $47.7 million during the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for certain Total Charges and Credits (those not related to interest, taxes, and/or depreciation and amortization) of $4.9 million.

Balance Sheet

Cash and cash equivalents are $43.1 million as of September 30, 2019, compared to $24.9 million as of December 31, 2018.

Total debt as of September 30, 2019 is $373.6 million with $35.8 million of such debt classified as short-term. Working capital for the Company totaled $192.9 million as of September 30, 2019. Net debt totaled $330.6 million as of September 30, 2019. Net debt has increased by $53.4 million since December 31, 2018 to fund working capital and capital spending to support our growth. As compared to fourth quarter of 2018 days sales outstanding levels, decreased accounts receivable collections of approximately $42 million have contributed significantly to the increase in working capital during 2019. We expect collections to improve during the fourth quarter of 2019.
