Having the right lenses in your kit bag means you get to tell your stories in your own creative and unique way but having too many lenses weighs you down. The EOS 2000D Travel Kit’s second lens —the Canon EF-S 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6 IS STM— offers travel photographers much-needed versatility on location. It is great for capturing all kinds of subjects, from landscapes to portraits, to action scenes, thanks to a broad focal length of 18 to 55 millimeters.



Each lens offers a 4-speed image stabilizer with stepper motor technology (STM) to reduce camera shake. The EF-S 18-55mm lens also offers super smooth HD video recording and Servo AF video mode. In this internet age, better quality photos and videos ensure you stand out from the crowd on your favourite social channels when posting, blogging, and vlogging - generating more likes, shares and follows for you, your passion, and your business.



“I enjoy exploring new places and getting up close with my subjects, so the small and light 2000D is a perfect travel camera. With the two lenses, I never miss a moment, and I especially like the 10-18mm lens,” says Rich Allela, a professional photographer from Kenya. “I love meeting new people, going to new places and experiencing different cultures because it creates powerful connections and memorable images. Amazingly light, two lenses, and WiFi connectivity, makes the 2000D the perfect travel companion.”
