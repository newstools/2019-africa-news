                            As part of our effort to support English-language learning in Chad, the U.S. Embassy invited English Language Specialist Lynn Zimmerman to N’Djamena to work with professors at King Faisal University. The one-week training was designed to help develop an English-teaching curriculum, including strategies for teaching English to university students. Our thanks to the professors for their excellent participation and to the University for hosting Dr. Zimmerman.
