                            We are saddened by the terrorist attacks that took place in Mali against a military camp in Boulkessi and military troops in Mondoro, claiming many lives and leaving several soldiers and civilians injured.



We condemn these heinous attacks, wish Allahâ€™s mercy upon those who lost their lives, speedy recovery to the wounded and offer our condolences to the brotherly people and Government of Mali.
