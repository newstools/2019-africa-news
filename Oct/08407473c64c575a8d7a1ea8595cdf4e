A Chinese teaching post was also established by Confucius institute in your school. The students'Â enthusiasm for learning Chinese is high, the Chinese songs sang by them are very impressive to me. The Chinese Embassy will continue to provide support to your school teaching activities, and willing to join hands with your school to promote the bilateral educational exchanges and cooperation.
