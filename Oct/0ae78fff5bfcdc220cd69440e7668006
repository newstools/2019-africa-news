Canon EMEA will move away from the cloud image storage industry and instead, focus on investing in its imaging technology and connected services that sit closer to its cameras, such as Canon image Gateway and Canon Camera Connect.

This gives Canon EMEA an opportunity to partner with experts in end-user services and as such, Irista users can have a complimentary 2-month membership of Adobe Lightroom (1TB), where users can easily edit, organise, store and share photos from anywhere.

Customers are encouraged to download all data from Irista before the service closes. Downloading images is a simple process and instructions are clearly outlined on the Irista website (Irista.com). Once the service closes on 31 January 2020, all customer data will be deleted.
