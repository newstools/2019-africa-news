Commenting on the award of the contracts, Averda CEO Malek Sukkar said:

“After five years of service in Casablanca, we are delighted to renew our commitment to communities across the city with fresh ideas and a very exciting range of brand-new services and solutions. I’m also pleased to announce a major investment in staff and equipment.”

Building upon its prior experience in Casablanca, Averda will complement its services with underground waste storage containers, side-loaded containers and watertight metal containers. Collectively, their deployment will allow Averda to handle significantly greater volumes of waste, helping the municipality to avoid the longstanding challenges relating to capacity in densely populated areas.

The contract, signed on 25 June, with the Commune of Casablanca, will see the introduction of new state of the art, heavy-duty equipment including waste compactors, bin washers, sweepers, loaders, tipper, tankers and bins. There will also be an increase of the labour force including manual sweepers, collection staff, truck drivers, controllers and support staff.
