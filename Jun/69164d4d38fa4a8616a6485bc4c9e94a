A recent review of proceedings was made and the Board approved the manner in which the labour conflict between ZRU and Mr Peter de Villiers was handled by the Disciplinary Committee.



In light of recent events the Board has sort guidance on how to handle the matter regarding national team players Denford Mutamangira and Tatenda Karuru.



Both players broke protocol by making unsanctioned statements in the media on behalf of their team mates without using the formal channel which is the players’ representative and committee.
