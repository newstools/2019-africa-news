JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, December 4, 2019/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            MSD (MSD.co.za), known as Merck & Co., Inc., (NYSE: MRK) in the United States and Canada, congratulates both Cote d’ Ivoire and Liberia on the successful launch of the National Immunisation Programme (NIP) for the Human-Papillomavirus (HPV - the main cause of cervical cancer).[1]



Approximately 530 000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer around the world each year.[2]  In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), cervical cancer incidence rates are the highest in the world (the prevalence of HPV in women with normal cytology is at an average of 24% in SSA) and the disease is the most common cause of cancer death among women in the region. [3]a,b  HPV16 and 18 are the most common genotypes in cervical cancer in SSA.3  Although HPV16 and 18 are associated with approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases [4], the various HPV genotypes also contribute to penile cancers, anal cancers, vulvar and vaginal cancers as well as genital warts (HPV6 and 11).3 

The launch of HPV programs in both Liberia and Cote d’ Ivoire



Cote d’ Ivoire has a population of 6.7 million women aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer and Liberia has a population of 1.4 million women in this risk category.[5],6 Current estimates are that, annually, 1 789 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 1 448 die from the disease in Cote d’ Ivoire.[6]  In Liberia, there are 548 new cervical cancer cases annually and 449 cervical cancer deaths.5  Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women aged 15 to 44 years in Cote D’ Ivoire and the first most frequent cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of age in Liberia. 5,6



“We are excited that Cote d’ Ivoire and Liberia have launched their HPV immunisation programmes. MSD is committed to the elimination of preventable HPV related cancers and diseases and a national immunisation programme is a critical step towards that. Well done to both Cote d’ Ivoire and Liberia” said Dr Priya Agrawal – MD MSD South Africa and SSA Cluster.
