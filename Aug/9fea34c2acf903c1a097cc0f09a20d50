WASHINGTON D.C., United States of America, August 7, 2019/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            On behalf of the American people, I extend my sincere congratulations to the Government and people of Côte d’Ivoire on the 59th anniversary of your independence.



Côte d’Ivoire is a remarkable example of economic growth and recovery from conflict, and the United States commends Côte d’Ivoire for the progress made in reforming your economy.  We appreciate your hosting a successful and dynamic 2019 AGOA Forum in Abidjan this summer.

The United States looks forward to many more decades of cooperation and friendship with the Ivoirian people.
