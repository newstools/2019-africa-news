Led globally by Stillwell Partners and on the ground in Africa by Republicom Group, Advertising Week Africa (Africa.AdvertisingWeek.com) 2019 brings a new, outstanding destination, joining the five other global cities as a place to recognise, celebrate and amplify Africa’s contribution to the global industry.

Over the past 15 years, Advertising Week events have provided the biggest platforms to showcase innovative approaches to the creative crafts, new collaborations and partnerships and next-generation thought leadership across the global marketing and advertising industry. Johannesburg now shares the stage with powerhouse cities, such as New York, London, Sydney, Tokyo and Mexico City, as the host of the prestigious four-day gathering, which will for the first time put Africa’s thriving creative industry on the global stage.

Advertising Week’s CEO Matt Scheckner says: “Many of the positive cultural shifts that we have seen in art, music, entertainment and film originate from Africa. It’s the perfect time to provide the international platform to share authentic African stories and showcase thought-provoking marketing and technological innovations sweeping the continent. It’s an exciting opportunity to bring internationally recognised professionals together with emerging talent to exchange ideas about how this vibrant continent is shaping global trends.”

“For us, Advertising Week provides a great platform to tell authentic African stories and showcase the great marketing and technology innovations and breakthroughs that has come out of Africa” said Tunji Adeyinka, Republicom Group Managing Director and Chair the Advertising Week Africa Advisory Council.
