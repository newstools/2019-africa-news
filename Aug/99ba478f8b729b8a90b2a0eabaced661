This will be the pair's second meeting in less than a month after the latter beat their hosts in a jaw dropping encounter played at Diggers Rugby Club in Kitwe. 

Zambia, who are yet to record a win in their inaugural Victoria Cup tournament, are looking at upsetting their hosts in this first return match. The Southern African nation is looking to redeem herself from the 43-23 loss to Kenya as they start their return fixtures.

Despite the hazy start to their Victoria Cup campaign, local rugby fans in Zambia are still confident of a good finish.
