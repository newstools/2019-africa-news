A unique idea that was born in 2013 after he noticed a challenge in the local industry in terms of getting access to film equipment.



Pulse Live Kenya (PulseLive.co.ke) explored the secret to his success and how he makes his fortunes in the profitable film industry which remains untapped in Kenya.



Mr Kihuha’s story is an inspiration to the youth since it celebrates innovation and also champions the idea of self employment.



In Kenya, it’s estimated that over 40% of youth are unemployed and the rate is particularly worrying.


                                I deal with making film equipment and I think I’m the only one who does that in the country
                            

“I deal with making film equipment and I think I’m the only one who does that in the country. What I do is not about money, I focus on my product and how it will reach a lot of people,” Protisa states.



He mentions that he was inspired by his father who was a blacksmith, adding that is passionate about empowering young people.



Kihuha trains youth who are in the film industry and has already trained over 40 young people who have expressed interest in the field of filmmaking.



He challenges the youth to come up with unique ideas and create their own paths to curb the crisis of unemployment in kenya.
