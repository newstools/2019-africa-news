‘’I extend my congratulations to both President Felipe Nyusi, and RENAMO President, Ossufo Momade, for their commitment to this process, and for the courage of all parties to the negotiations to set aside their differences in the pursuit of peace.’’

“Ireland is proud to support Mozambique’s peace process through the contribution of professional expertise by the Defence Forces to the Joint Technical Group for Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration.”

Minister Kehoe added:

“This is indeed a historic occasion and an important opportunity for Ireland to support the people of Mozambique. I would like to thank Colonel Hathaway, Ireland’s representative on the Joint Technical Group, for his participation and commitment to the process.”

“Ireland’s substantial contribution to international peace support operations depends on the readiness of Defence Forces personnel to serve overseas in often difficult and dangerous circumstances. Colonel Hathaway should be very proud of his contribution to this process, serving the cause of international peace and security in the best traditions of our Defence Forces.”
